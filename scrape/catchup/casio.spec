description :  From the MASTER OF G Series MUDMASTER, the watch that is designed and engineered to withstand rough land environments, come carbon resin models that incorporate a new type of structure.
The case is made of high-rigidity carbon material to protect against damage and deformation due to impact and other rough treatment, while metal button pipes ensure a tighter seal against the external environment. A filter further protects against the invasion of mud, for the high level of dust and mud resistance required when in severe environments. In addition, the dual back cover consists of a stainless steel panel back and an outer cover made of shock resistant fine resin embedded with glass fibers.
The bezel is formed of three layers of fine resin with carbon fiber inserts. The top layer is transparent, resulting in a bezel that shows the embedded carbon material.
Quad Sensor capabilities use compact sensors that make it possible to pack compass, altitude/barometer, and temperature measurements, along with an accelerometer that keeps track of your step count, into a compact configuration. This provides the outdoor adventurer with the means to keep track of the surrounding environment while on the go.
A special G-SHOCK app, which simplifies configuration of watch settings, also includes a new Mission Function. The app automatically records altitude data measured by the watch and route information acquired by a smartphone's GPS. Manually obtained altitude points can be plotted on your route.
Altitude measurement and the step count are used to perform consumed calorie calculations that take up and down grades into consideration, and to record the results in an activity log.
A watch button operation can be used to record your current location with the app. Then the second hand indicates the bearing to the recorded location, while the digital display shows the distance to the location.
These new models also support Mode Switching Customization.
You can use the app to enable or disable modes individually so only enabled modes appear. You can even specify the sequence to be used when displaying the modes.

description :  The G-SHOCK MT-G combines metal and resin into forms of essential functional elegance, and also provides TRIPLE G RESIST durability. This new model add a selection of MT-G Series mid-size designs that is design to fit well to the wrist.
The faces, various parts, and inner surfaces of the bands sport attractive accent colors. The case and band of the all black ion-plated model has metallic blue accents.
The inside surfaces of the bands incorporates fine resin parts that allow the use of attractive colors, and makes the band lightweight and tough. Fine resin parts also have relatively lower thermal conductivity than stainless steel, so even in the cold of winter, less of the cold is transmitted to the wrist.
A shock-resistant structure integrates the lugs that connect the band and the pipes that link the bezel and back cover into a single piece to create a wall-like frame that protects the watch's module.
Connected Engine supports time correction using a time calibration signal and Bluetooth® connection. A Bluetooth® communication function makes it possible to connect with a smartphone running the G-SHOCK Connected* app and obtain accurate time information from an on-line time server. MULTIBAND 6 automatically adjusts time settings based on reception of one of six time calibration signals around the globe for automatic time adjustment when you are within the range of a signal, even if connection with a smartphone is not possible for some reason. All of this means that timekeeping is accurate, no matter where in the world you happen to be. These new MT-G models combine metal and resin in a way that creates an innovative shock-resistant structure and a work of timepiece beauty, which houses a new module that ensures timekeeping is always accurate.

To mark the occasion, CASIO is releasing the DW5750E to bring back the look of a historical favorite under a back-to-original-basics theme.  The DW5700C was originally released in 1987 as the first basic G-SHOCK model with a round design. It was not sold domestically in Japan, but it could be seen on the wrists of famous musicians around the globe, ultimately making the DW5700C a classic worldwide hit. This model has been reissued a number of times in the past as well to mark special G-SHOCK occasions.  The design and other aspects of the original models have been reproduced for this new version. Basic model functions include stopwatch and timer, along with EL backlight and more.

description :  LIMITED EDITION Carbon Core Guard structure
From G-SHOCK, the watch that is constantly testing new limits in timekeeping toughness, comes a new series with Carbon Core Guard structure, which takes toughness to a new level.  The case is made of fine resin that incorporates carbon fiber for light weight along with rigidity that is superior to that of resin. This material protects the internal module from shock-induced damage and deformation. The dual back cover protects the back surface against impact.  Button structure shock resistance has been improved, which eliminates the need for external button guards. In addition, making the case itself shock resistant eliminates the need to affix the band to the case, which previously played a role in achieving shock resistance. This is the first G-SHOCK model to employ a slide-lever type band for quick and simple band detachment and replacement band. The face of the watch consists of a disk pointer and raised hour markers for a look of bold toughness.  This new standard bearer of the G-SHOCK lineup combines a new shock resistant structure with urban outdoor styling that reflects its toughness.Interchangeable Bands Included – Black:  Resin, Green:  Cordura

description :  PRO TREK's ability to combine the best that technology has to offer and innovative designs has made it the timepiece of choice for climbers, hikers, campers, and other outdoor enthusiasts. Now the PRT-B50 Series adds Bluetooth® capabilities that enable data communication with a smartphone running the PRO TREK Connected app, for the ultimate in ease of use.
The Quad Sensor system uses compact sensors that make it possible to pack compass, altitude/barometer, and temperature measurements, along with an accelerometer that keeps track of your step count, into a compactconfiguration. Calorie calculations use both step count and altitude information to take upgrades and downgrades into consideration, andcalories burned values are recorded by the app. The app automatically records altitude data measured by the watch and route information acquired
by a smartphone's GPS, and you can manually plot altitude points along your route using a Trekking Log feature. You can also perform a watch button operation to record your current location in memory. Then after you move to a different place, a Location Indicator will point to the direction and display the distance back to the registered location. This makes it easy to
determine the relationship between the two locations, which is an essential capability for outdoor activities.

description :  The latest additions to the ECB-900 Series of EDIFICE metal chronograph models with advanced features and functions that allow linking with your smartphone. These new models feature digital displays at 12 o’clock and 9 o’clock, which team up with the analog indications to show information in an easy-to-understand format. Establishing a Bluetooth connection between these watches and a smartphone ensures accurate timekeeping, including summer time switching, in virtually any country in the world. A phone can also be used to configure a variety of watch settings.  A motorsports inspired 1/1000-second stopwatch comes with memory for 200 lap time records, and recording a lap time causes the lower right dial to indicate the average speed. A smartphone app lets you select from more than 300 cities for your World Time City, and simplifies alarm and countdown timer settings.
These watches also come with Super Illuminator, which uses high-brightness LED illumination that automatically illuminates both the analog face and the digital displays are automatically illuminated whenever you angle the watch towards your face where lighting is dim. This impressive collection of advanced features and functions is powered by a solar power system, with a CASIO-original shade dispersing solar panel that minimizes shading from the watch hands for highly efficient power generation. The result is uninterrupted, reliable operation without the need for periodic battery replacements.
All of this and much more makes EDIFICE a leader in the 1/1000-second world of modern motorsports.

Measurement of a lap time calculates and displays an average speed value based on a circuit distance you specify using the smartphone app.

description :  While supplies last. See details in cart.This is the latest new addition to the MASTER OF G MUDMASTER Series. Mud Resist construction helps to ensure that nothing gets into the watch when down and dirty work takes you deep into the dirt and sludge. Multiple gaskets are used on the pipes that guide buttons and shafts, which keeps mud out. These pipes not only act to protect buttons from impact, they also enhance button operation.In addition, Twin Sensor capabilities provide instant access to direction and temperature information when needed under tough conditions.The face of the watch is marked with large Arabian numerals at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock for easy reading. The face is illuminated by a Super Illuminator, high-brightness auto LED light to ensure high visibility under virtually any conditions imaginable.The band surface is processed to resemble a cloth band texture, and the hour and minute hands are shaped with points that make them resemble warning markers. All buttons have a checkered surface for surer operation, and the overall design is tough and rugged.

description :  These are the latest additions to the new POWER TRAINER sports lineup from G-SHOCK.
The good-looking designs and utility colors of these models maximize coordination possibilities with both everyday fashions and training wear.
Function-wise, these watches link with the G-SHOCK Connected phone app to provide access to a number of functions that enhance workouts. Daily health and fitness support functions include a 3-axis accelerometer that keeps track of step counts, a Multi-Timer that lets you create up to 20 timer combinations of five timers each, memory for up to 200 lap records, and more. The app also makes it possible to maintain step count logs with five exercise intensity levels, to calculate the calories you burn, to specify a daily step target, to create timer combinations and send them to the watch, to store stopwatch measurement data, to view data, and more. All of this combines to help you plan and record your workouts, making them more effective and enjoyable.
Other features include app-based auto time setting correction and other features for more efficient timekeeping, and an Auto LED Light to facilitate workouts in areas where lighting is dim.
Back wings on the inside of the bands where they connect to the case, a new band ring shape that prevents sliding, and more band holes to allow better tightness adjustment, all add up to a more comfortable fit. You can make fine adjustments to the band size.

description :  These new MTG-B1000 models incorporate a new shock-resistant structure, a smaller case size, and improved fit to the wrist to create a selection of new additions to the MT-G lineup of TRIPLE G RESIST metal-and-resin combination models.
The new shock resistant structure of these models is the result of the G-SHOCK MT-G constant pursuit of improved strength and durability. A New Core Guard structure integrates the lugs and pipes that connect the band into single pieces, creating a wall that isolates the watch's module from impact. The resin of the center case is also reinforced with carbon fibers, which further enhances module protection, while reducing overall weight.
These watches come with a new Connected Engine module for improved timekeeping accuracy. A Bluetooth® communication function makes it possible to connect with a smartphone running the G-SHOCK Connected* app and obtain accurate time information from an on-line time server. MULTIBAND 6 automatically adjusts time settings based on reception of one of six time calibration signals around the globe, for automatic time adjustment when you are within the range of a signal, even if connection with a smartphone is not possible for some reason. All of this means that timekeeping is accurate, no matter where in the world you happen to be.
Other features include high-brightness LED illumination, World Time, stopwatch, and more. Stable operation is ensured by a CASIO original Tough Solar charging system.

description :  From G-SHOCK, the watch brand that is constantly setting new standards for timekeeping toughness, comes G-STEEL, a watch series with a new "layer guard structure. Different materials are used for the bezel to create a two-layer structure that adds a new dimension of shock resistant. For models that use stainless steel in the upper part, shock absorbing resin is employed in the lower part. If resin is used in the upper part, fine resin is used in the lower part to cushion against impact from the upper part. This also has made it possible create a wide range of different designs.
The GST-S100 model features a tough, quality design molded of resin.

description :  From G-SHOCK, the watch that is constantly testing new limits in timekeeping toughness, comes a new series with Carbon Core Guard structure, which takes toughness to a new level.
The case is made of fine resin that incorporates carbon fiber for light weight along with rigidity that is superior to that of resin. This material protects the internal module from shock-induced damage and deformation. The dual back cover protects the back surface against impact.
Button structure shock resistance has been improved, which eliminates the need for external button guards.
The face of the watch consists of a disk pointer and raised hour markers for a look of bold toughness.
This new standard bearer of the G-SHOCK lineup combines a new shock resistant structure with urban outdoor styling that reflects its toughness.
A new level of toughness
Carbon Core Guard structure
A new carbon core guard structure protects the module by enclosing it in a carbon case made of fine resin embedded with carbon fibers for outstanding strength, crack resistance, and durability. The new shock resistant structure marks an important advance of G-SHOCK core technology, making this model the new standard bearer of the G-SHOCK lineup.

description :  The latest additions to the ECB-900 Series of EDIFICE metal chronograph models with advanced features and functions that allow linking with your smartphone. These new models feature digital displays at 12 o’clock and 9 o’clock, which team up with the analog indications to show information in an easy-to-understand format. Establishing a Bluetooth connection between these watches and a smartphone ensures accurate timekeeping, including summer time switching, in virtually any country in the world. A phone can also be used to configure a variety of watch settings.
A motorsports inspired 1/1000-second stopwatch comes with memory for 200 lap time records, and recording a lap time causes the lower right dial to indicate the average speed. A smartphone app lets you select from more than 300 cities for your World Time City, and simplifies alarm and countdown timer settings.
These watches also come with Super Illuminator, which uses high-brightness LED illumination that automatically illuminates both the analog face and the digital displays are automatically illuminated whenever you angle the watch towards your face where lighting is dim. This impressive collection of advanced features and functions is powered by a solar power system, with a CASIO-original shade dispersing solar panel that minimizes shading from the watch hands for highly efficient power generation. The result is uninterrupted, reliable operation without the need for periodic battery replacements.
All of this and much more makes EDIFICE a leader in the 1/1000-second world of modern motorsports.

description :  From the G-SHOCK MR-G flagship lineup, comes a new kurozonae theme model. Since ancient times, kurozonae has given military weapons a distinctive uniform black color that has been a symbol of strength and power, and the distinctive black coloring on the exterior finish and the face of this model reflects this image. The black metal is finished in a way that makes its dark and light facets resemble the fine gradations seen in black ink paintings.  The bezel is made of COBARION®, a Japan-developed cobalt base alloy that is twice as hard as stainless steel and has a shine that is equal to that of platinum. High-level cutting and polishing technology is used to carefully shape and polish each individual bezel to a level of never-before-possible hardness and elegance.This new model is designed to receive time calibration signals, GPS satellite signals, and Bluetooth®, all of which can be used to correct the current time setting for outstanding accuracy.  Timeless traditional Japanese beauty plush the latest in advanced innovative technology combine to create the next generation in fashionable, full-metal timekeeping.Returns will only be accepted if product is in original packaging and protectant film is in place.

A smartphone app lets you select from more than 300 cities for your World Time City, and simplifies alarm and countdown timer settings.This watch also comes with Super Illuminator, which uses high brightness LED illumination that automatically illuminates both the analog face and the digital displays are automatically illuminated whenever you angle the watch towards your face where lighting is dim. This impressive collection of advanced features and functions is powered by a solar power system, with a CASIO original shade dispersing solar panel that minimizes shading from the watch hands for highly efficient power generation. The result is uninterrupted, reliable operation without the need for periodic battery replacements.All of this and much more makes EDIFICE a leader in the 1/1000-second world of modern motorsports.Speed IndicatorMeasurement of a lap time calculates and displays an average speed value based on a circuit distance you specify using the smartphone app.

description :  These Quad Sensor Bluetooth connected G-SHOCK Master of G “GRAVITYMASTER” GRB200 models pack flight mission essential functions into a tough and rugged carbon core guard structure. 
A high-strength, highly weather-resistant Carbon Core Guard Structure protects the module with a resin case reinforced with carbon fibers. This, combined with world-renowned G-SHOCK shock resistance, creates a structure that is also highly vibration resistant. 
The bezel is made up of three layers of resin with carbon fiber inserts. The top layer is semi-transparent to reveal the carbon material inside. The three buttons on the right side of the watch are arranged in a way that makes them resemble a fighter jet control stick, while also contributing to ease of operation. 
The Quad Sensor system of these models uses compact sensors that make it possible to pack compass, altitude/barometer, and temperature measurement capabilities, along with an accelerometer that keeps track of your step count, into a compact  configuration. This makes it easy to keep tabs on the natural environment around you and to maintain logs of your activities for comprehensive flight mission support. A special G-SHOCK phone app simplifies configuration of watch settings, and also provides a Mission Function.

description :  The new GBX100 models are the latest additions to the G-LIDE lineup of G-SHOCK sports watches, which are a favorite choice among the world's top surfers. These new models come with the ability to display information required by surfers (high tide and low tide times and levels), and to use a phone application for simple selection of one of approximately 3,300 locations around the globe. The wide face and a high-definition MIP (Memory In Pixel) LCD improves display readability of standard functions like Tide Graph, Moon Data, high tide and low tide times, and sunrise and sunset times. This provides important information about current conditions at a glance, which, in combination with a collection of training measurement functions (distance, speed, pace, lap, pitch), provides plenty of support for surfers who meet new challenges around the globe. In addition to powerful functions, these new models also incorporate advances in design, structure, and materials. The bezels of these models are made of resin and metal to allow them to withstand the impact of underwater rocks better. The surface of the bezel has a stainless steel cover with a hairline and honed finish that creates a look of elegant toughness. A resin guard structure that protects against impact from any direction combines with a button guard at 6 o'clock, which delivers outstanding G-SHOCK protection. The end of the soft urethane band at 6 o'clock has slits to allow the draining of water and sweat for improved comfort.

description :  These G-SHOCK G-MOVE GBDH1000 Series models pack heart rate measurement and GPS capabilities into a choice of black or white designs made of semitransparent resin. The result is powerfully vibrant timepieces that look great no matter where they are worn.
Useful workout functions include an optical sensor for heart rate measurement, along with bearing, altitude/barometric pressure, and temperature sensors, and an accelerometer for step counting. These five sensors help to keep you in close touch with your current activity in real-time. The ability to receive GPS signals lets you access location information when you need it. When used in combination with the stopwatch, you can keep track of running information like distance, speed, pace, and more. The watch uses your heart rate and speed data to calculate a VO2max value, which is an indicator of your cardio-pulmonary capacity. This measurement is useful when trying to increase stamina for running and other activities. A phone app is available to help you configure watch settings and manage your training data.
You can monitor your current fitness level and training progress, and even automatically create a training plan based on targets specified by you. VO2max calculation and other data analysis capabilities use a library by FIRSTBEAT, a renowned sports science company.
Algorithms of improved accuracy support a higher level of training. The surface form of the back covers of these models reduces interference with the back of the hand, while a soft urethane band provides a better fit to the wrist. Bi-color molded buttons are designed for ease of use, while a high-definition MIP LCD makes display information more legible. Both USB and solar charging are supported, and solar charging can be used to power daily operations (except for pulse monitoring and GPS). Both of these models provide renowned G-SHOCK toughness along with new outdoor functions.

description :  This is new variations on the full-metal GMWB5000 that incorporate titanium material into their square-face design, which inherits plenty of the DNA of the original G-SHOCK DW5000C.
The case, band, bezel, and back cover of this new model is made of lightweight, easy-on-the-wrist titanium. Titanium is notorious as being a material that is difficult to work with, and its application in this model represents a significant achievement. The surface of the metal is finished with a diamond like carbon (DLC) coating that protects it against scratching and other damage.

The GMWB5000TCF model with titanium case, bezel, band, and back, which is laser engraved with a distinctive camouflage pattern. After a DLC coating is applied to the case and band, the gradations of the camouflage pattern are created by using dot patterns of three different sizes: small, medium, and large.

These watches can link with the GPS of a smartphone for quicker calibration of distance measurements, enabling more accurate running distance measurements, even during use without a phone connection.
Distance measurements used in combination with the stopwatch let you keep track of your running pace, and also enable use of an Auto Lap feature that automatically keeps track of times over a specific distance.Other standard features include a step tracker (pedometer), interval timers (up to 20 sets of five timers each), lap time measurement (up to 140 records for up to 100 runs), and calories burned measurement, all of which provide plenty of support for your daily training. Also, new phone apps are now available to help you configure watch settings more easily and manage your workouts. In addition to Life Log and Activity History apps, you can automatically create a training plan based on targets specified by you.
The displays of these watches use a high-definition MIP LCD, while Super Illuminator face illumination keeps face information easy to read, even in the dark. The soft urethane band material provides improved comfort, while a large number of band holes let you adjust the fit to your particular wrist.
The watch maintains a constant Bluetooth® connection with your phone to support auto time adjustment, phone notifications, step tracking, and other functions throughout the day. Even so, battery life is approximately two years between replacements.From daily health management to improved running endurance, these new G-SHOCK MOVE models provide tools that support a wide range of fitness needs.

description :  These G-SHOCK G-MOVE GBDH1000 Series models pack heart rate measurement and GPS capabilities into a choice of black or white designs made of semitransparent resin. The result is powerfully vibrant timepieces that look great no matter where they are worn.
Useful workout functions include an optical sensor for heart rate measurement, along with bearing, altitude/barometric pressure, and temperature sensors, and an accelerometer for step counting. These five sensors help to keep you in close touch with your current activity in real-time. The ability to receive GPS signals lets you access location information when you need it. When used in combination with the stopwatch, you can keep track of running information like distance, speed, pace, and more. The watch uses your heart rate and speed data to calculate a VO2max value, which is an indicator of your cardio-pulmonary capacity. This measurement is useful when trying to increase stamina for running and other activities. A phone app is available to help you configure watch settings and manage your training data.
You can monitor your current fitness level and training progress, and even automatically create a training plan based on targets specified by you. VO2max calculation and other data analysis capabilities use a library by FIRSTBEAT, a renowned sports science company.
Algorithms of improved accuracy support a higher level of training. The surface form of the back covers of these models reduces interference with the back of the hand, while a soft urethane band provides a better fit to the wrist. Bi-color molded buttons are designed for ease of use, while a high-definition MIP LCD makes display information more legible. Both USB and solar charging are supported, and solar charging can be used to power daily operations (except for pulse monitoring and GPS). Both of these models provide renowned G-SHOCK toughness along with new outdoor functions.

description :  These Quad Sensor Bluetooth connected G-SHOCK Master of G “GRAVITYMASTER” GRB200 models pack flight mission essential functions into a tough and rugged carbon core guard structure. 
A high-strength, highly weather-resistant Carbon Core Guard Structure protects the module with a resin case reinforced with carbon fibers. This, combined with world-renowned G-SHOCK shock resistance, creates a structure that is also highly vibration resistant. 
The bezel is made up of three layers of resin with carbon fiber inserts. The top layer is semi-transparent to reveal the carbon material inside. The three buttons on the right side of the watch are arranged in a way that makes them resemble a fighter jet control stick, while also contributing to ease of operation. 
The Quad Sensor system of these models uses compact sensors that make it possible to pack compass, altitude/barometer, and temperature measurement capabilities, along with an accelerometer that keeps track of your step count, into a compact  configuration. This makes it easy to keep tabs on the natural environment around you and to maintain logs of your activities for comprehensive flight mission support. A special G-SHOCK phone app simplifies configuration of watch settings, and also provides a Mission Function.

description :  The new GWFA1000's are the first analog models for the FROGMAN Series of MASTER OF G ISO 200m diver-level water resistant watches. Maintaining the asymmetrical face design that has been the iconic look of this series since its start in 1993, these new models show Home Time, Dual Time, tide information, and dive time measurement in analog format. The carbon monocoque structure of this model incorporates the case and back cover into a single unit. The carbon fiber-reinforced resin has a low water absorption coefficient and resists hydrolysis, which results in a higher level of water resistance and greater strength. This, along with the monocoque case, enables ISO 200m diver-level water resistance. Function-wise, these models feature a new module that uses an always connected Bluetooth ® system, so settings can be configured using your phone instead of watch button operations. A G-SHOCK Connected app can be downloaded to a smartphone and linked with the watch. Then, you can select one of approximately 3,000 locations around the globe and view tide information there. You can also view diving log records on your phone and manage measurement data more efficiently.

description :  G-SHOCK is an unbreakable timepiece built from a ‘Never Give Up’ philosophy that makes it perfectly equipped to support UK Servicemen - both on and off-duty – all over the world. G-SHOCK is already the watch of choice for many in the Armed Forces, and this limited-edition release further cements the partnership as an official licensee of the Ministry of Defense. 
Designed in conjunction with the Royal Air Force, the watch has been built to accommodate the severe environments faced by pilots using a carbon core guard structure in their signature grey colorway. This, combined with world-renowned G-SHOCK shock resistance, creates a structure that is highly vibration resistant. The bezel is made up of three layers of resin with carbon fiber inserts, with the top layer being semi-transparent to reveal the carbon material inside. The special edition timepiece features design elements inspired by aviation, including the three buttons on the right side of the watch arranged in a way that makes them resemble a fighter jet control stick while also contributing to ease of operation. Additionally, the stealth colorway is inspired by the Eurofighter Typhoon, designed to be difficult to distinguish in the sky during operations. 
The GRAVITYMASTER GRB200 model also features a Quad Sensor system which makes it possible to pack compass, altitude/barometer and temperature measurement capabilities along with an accelerometer that keeps track of step count, into a compact figuration. This makes it easy to keep tabs on the natural environment and to maintain logs of all activity for comprehensive flight mission support. The timepiece features location and activity-tracking technology through the Quad Sensor system. As part of the Bluetooth® connectivity capabilities via the G-SHOCK Connected App, it is equipped with a special function within the app that provides a mission log, location indicator, auto altitude calibration and calories burned.

description :  The new GWFA1000's are the first analog models for the FROGMAN Series of MASTER OF G ISO 200m diver-level water resistant watches. Maintaining the asymmetrical face design that has been the iconic look of this series since its start in 1993, these new models show Home Time, Dual Time, tide information, and dive time measurement in analog format. The carbon monocoque structure of this model incorporates the case and back cover into a single unit. The carbon fiber-reinforced resin has a low water absorption coefficient and resists hydrolysis, which results in a higher level of water resistance and greater strength. This, along with the monocoque case, enables ISO 200m diver-level water resistance. Function-wise, these models feature a new module that uses an always connected Bluetooth ® system, so settings can be configured using your phone instead of watch button operations. A G-SHOCK Connected app can be downloaded to a smartphone and linked with the watch. Then, you can select one of approximately 3,000 locations around the globe and view tide information there. You can also view diving log records on your phone and manage measurement data more efficiently.

description :  these are the latest additions to the G-SHOCK MOVE lineup of sports watches, now with Bluetooth® capabilities that allow continuous connection with a smartphone.
These watches can link with the GPS of a smartphone for quicker calibration of distance measurements, enabling more accurate running distance measurements, even during use without a phone connection.
Distance measurements used in combination with the stopwatch let you keep track of your running pace, and also enable use of an Auto Lap feature that automatically keeps track of times over a specific distance.Other standard features include a step tracker (pedometer), interval timers (up to 20 sets of five timers each), lap time measurement (up to 140 records for up to 100 runs), and calories burned measurement, all of which provide plenty of support for your daily training. Also, new phone apps are now available to help you configure watch settings more easily and manage your workouts. In addition to Life Log and Activity History apps, you can automatically create a training plan based on targets specified by you.
The displays of these watches use a high-definition MIP LCD, while Super Illuminator face illumination keeps face information easy to read, even in the dark. The soft urethane band material provides improved comfort, while a large number of band holes let you adjust the fit to your particular wrist.
The watch maintains a constant Bluetooth® connection with your phone to support auto time adjustment, phone notifications, step tracking, and other functions throughout the day. Even so, battery life is approximately two years between replacements.From daily health management to improved running endurance, these new G-SHOCK MOVE models provide tools that support a wide range of fitness needs.

description :  These new MTG-B1000 models incorporate a new shock-resistant structure, a smaller case size, and improved fit to the wrist to create a selection of new additions to the MT-G lineup of TRIPLE G RESIST metal-and-resin combination models.
The new shock resistant structure of these models is the result of the G-SHOCK MT-G constant pursuit of improved strength and durability. A New Core Guard structure integrates the lugs and pipes that connect the band into single pieces, creating a wall that isolates the watch's module from impact. The resin of the center case is also reinforced with carbon fibers, which further enhances module protection, while reducing overall weight.
These watches come with a new Connected Engine module for improved timekeeping accuracy. A Bluetooth® communication function makes it possible to connect with a smartphone running the G-SHOCK Connected* app and obtain accurate time information from an on-line time server. MULTIBAND 6 automatically adjusts time settings based on reception of one of six time calibration signals around the globe, for automatic time adjustment when you are within the range of a signal, even if connection with a smartphone is not possible for some reason. All of this means that timekeeping is accurate, no matter where in the world you happen to be.
Other features include high-brightness LED illumination, World Time, stopwatch, and more. Stable operation is ensured by a CASIO original Tough Solar charging system.

description :  These Quad Sensor Bluetooth connected G-SHOCK Master of G “GRAVITYMASTER” GRB200 models pack flight mission essential functions into a tough and rugged carbon core guard structure. 
A high-strength, highly weather-resistant Carbon Core Guard Structure protects the module with a resin case reinforced with carbon fibers. This, combined with world-renowned G-SHOCK shock resistance, creates a structure that is also highly vibration resistant. 
The bezel is made up of three layers of resin with carbon fiber inserts. The top layer is semi-transparent to reveal the carbon material inside. The three buttons on the right side of the watch are arranged in a way that makes them resemble a fighter jet control stick, while also contributing to ease of operation. 
The Quad Sensor system of these models uses compact sensors that make it possible to pack compass, altitude/barometer, and temperature measurement capabilities, along with an accelerometer that keeps track of your step count, into a compact  configuration. This makes it easy to keep tabs on the natural environment around you and to maintain logs of your activities for comprehensive flight mission support. A special G-SHOCK phone app simplifies configuration of watch settings, and also provides a Mission Function.

description :  The new GWFA1000's are the first analog models for the FROGMAN Series of MASTER OF G ISO 200m diver-level water resistant watches. Maintaining the asymmetrical face design that has been the iconic look of this series since its start in 1993, these new models show Home Time, Dual Time, tide information, and dive time measurement in analog format. The carbon monocoque structure of this model incorporates the case and back cover into a single unit. The carbon fiber-reinforced resin has a low water absorption coefficient and resists hydrolysis, which results in a higher level of water resistance and greater strength. This, along with the monocoque case, enables ISO 200m diver-level water resistance. Function-wise, these models feature a new module that uses an always connected Bluetooth ® system, so settings can be configured using your phone instead of watch button operations. A G-SHOCK Connected app can be downloaded to a smartphone and linked with the watch. Then, you can select one of approximately 3,000 locations around the globe and view tide information there. You can also view diving log records on your phone and manage measurement data more efficiently.

description :  The G-SHOCK MT-G combines metal and resin into forms of essential functional elegance, and also provides TRIPLE G RESIST durability. This new model add a selection of MT-G Series mid-size designs that is design to fit well to the wrist.
The faces, various parts, and inner surfaces of the bands sport attractive accent colors. The silver case and band model has metallic red accents.
The inside surfaces of the bands incorporates fine resin parts that allow the use of attractive colors, and makes the band lightweight and tough. Fine resin parts also have relatively lower thermal conductivity than stainless steel, so even in the cold of winter, less of the cold is transmitted to the wrist.
A shock-resistant structure integrates the lugs that connect the band and the pipes that link the bezel and back cover into a single piece to create a wall-like frame that protects the watch's module.
Connected Engine supports time correction using a time calibration signal and Bluetooth® connection. A Bluetooth® communication function makes it possible to connect with a smartphone running the G-SHOCK Connected* app and obtain accurate time information from an on-line time server. MULTIBAND 6 automatically adjusts time settings based on reception of one of six time calibration signals around the globe for automatic time adjustment when you are within the range of a signal, even if connection with a smartphone is not possible for some reason. All of this means that timekeeping is accurate, no matter where in the world you happen to be.

description :  These are the latest additions to the new G-SHOCK MOVE  lineup of sports watches, which are equipped with heart rate monitor and GPS.
Useful workout functions include an optical sensor for heart rate measurement, along with bearing, altitude/barometric pressure, and temperature sensors, and an accelerometer for step counting.These five sensors help to keep you in close touch of your current activity in real time. The ability to receive GPS signals lets you access location information when you need it. This, when used in combination with the stopwatch, makes it possible for you to keep track of running information like distance, speed, pace, and more. Your heart rate and speed is used to calculate a VO2 max value, which is an indicator of your cardio-pulmonary capacity.
This measurement is useful when trying to increase stamina for running and other activities. In addition, new phone apps are now available to help you configure watch settings more easily and manage your workouts. You can monitor your current fitness level and training progress, and even automatically create a training plan based on targets specified by you. VO2 max calculation and other data analysis capabilities use a library by FIRSTBEAT, a renowned sport science company. Algorithms of improved accuracy support a higher level of training. The surface form of the back covers of these models reduces interference with the back of the hand, while a soft urethane band provides a better fit to the wrist. Bi-color molded buttons are designed for ease of use, while a high-definition MIP LCD makes display information more legible. Both USB and solar charging are supported, and solar charging can be used to power daily operation (except for pulse monitoring and GPS).
Renowned G-SHOCK toughness along with new outdoor functions for a new selection of G-SHOCK MOVE timepieces.

description :  These new MTG-B1000 models incorporate a new shock-resistant structure, a smaller case size, and improved fit to the wrist to create a selection of new additions to the MT-G lineup of TRIPLE G RESIST metal-and-resin combination models.
The new shock resistant structure of these models is the result of the G-SHOCK MT-G constant pursuit of improved strength and durability. A New Core Guard structure integrates the lugs and pipes that connect the band into single pieces, creating a wall that isolates the watch's module from impact. The resin of the center case is also reinforced with carbon fibers, which further enhances module protection, while reducing overall weight.
These watches come with a new Connected Engine module for improved timekeeping accuracy. A Bluetooth® communication function makes it possible to connect with a smartphone running the G-SHOCK Connected* app and obtain accurate time information from an on-line time server. MULTIBAND 6 automatically adjusts time settings based on reception of one of six time calibration signals around the globe, for automatic time adjustment when you are within the range of a signal, even if connection with a smartphone is not possible for some reason. All of this means that timekeeping is accurate, no matter where in the world you happen to be.
Other features include high-brightness LED illumination, World Time, stopwatch, and more. Stable operation is ensured by a CASIO original Tough Solar charging system.

description :  This G-STEEL variation is a new signature model that was designed under the supervision of NBA professional basketball player Rui Hachimura.
The hour marker at 8 o'clock is red, representing Hachimura's jersey number. Also, the Japanese word for 8 is hachi, which is also part of Hachimura's name. The button pipe of the Bluetooth® connection button at 8 o'clock and the indicator disk are also done in red.
The gold IP (ion plating) of the bezel and case parts along with a Rui Hachimura logo on the band ring and package create a bold, sporty look befitting of a special model such as this.
But the great-looking design of this model is only half of the story. A simple operation connects with the G-SHOCK Connected phone app for quick and easy time adjustments, simplified timer and other function settings, phone number searches and more. A high-brightness LED light enables easy reading of the display, even in the dark.
This new tough, sporty and fashionable timepiece captures the essence of everything that Rui Hachimura represents.

description :  From the MASTER OF G Series MUDMASTER, the watch that is designed and engineered to withstand rough land environments, come carbon resin models that incorporate a new type of structure.
The case is made of high-rigidity carbon material to protect against damage and deformation due to impact and other rough treatment, while metal button pipes ensure a tighter seal against the external environment. A filter further protects against the invasion of mud, for the high level of dust and mud resistance required when in severe environments. In addition, the dual back cover consists of a stainless steel panel back and an outer cover made of shock resistant fine resin embedded with glass fibers.
Quad Sensor capabilities use compact sensors that make it possible to pack compass, altitude/barometer, and temperature measurements, along with an accelerometer that keeps track of your step count, into a compact configuration. 
A special G-SHOCK app, which simplifies configuration of watch settings, also includes a new Mission Function. The app automatically records altitude data measured by the watch and route information acquired by a smartphone's GPS. Manually obtained altitude points can be plotted on your route.

description :  This is the latest new addition to the MASTER OF G MUDMASTER Series. Mud Resist construction helps to ensure that nothing gets into the watch when down and dirty work takes you deep into the dirt and sludge. Multiple gaskets are used on the pipes that guide buttons and shafts, which keeps mud out. These pipes not only act to protect buttons from impact, they also enhance button operation.
In addition, Twin Sensor capabilities provide instant access to direction and temperature information when needed under tough conditions.
The face of the watch is marked with large Arabian numerals at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock for easy reading. The face is illuminated by a Super Illuminator, high-brightness auto LED light to ensure high visibility under virtually any conditions imaginable.
The band surface is processed to resemble a cloth band texture, and the hour and minute hands are shaped with points that make them resemble warning markers. All buttons have a checkered surface for surer operation, and the overall design is tough and rugged.

description :  The new GBX100 models are the latest additions to the G-LIDE lineup of G-SHOCK sports watches, which are a favorite choice among the world's top surfers. These new models come with the ability to display information required by surfers (high tide and low tide times and levels), and to use a phone application for simple selection of one of approximately 3,300 locations around the globe. The wide face and a high-definition MIP (Memory In Pixel) LCD improves display readability of standard functions like Tide Graph, Moon Data, high tide and low tide times, and sunrise and sunset times. This provides important information about current conditions at a glance, which, in combination with a collection of training measurement functions (distance, speed, pace, lap, pitch), provides plenty of support for surfers who meet new challenges around the globe. In addition to powerful functions, these new models also incorporate advances in design, structure, and materials. The bezels of these models are made of resin and metal to allow them to withstand the impact of underwater rocks better. The surface of the bezel has a stainless steel cover with a hairline and honed finish that creates a look of elegant toughness. A resin guard structure that protects against impact from any direction combines with a button guard at 6 o'clock, which delivers outstanding G-SHOCK protection. The end of the soft urethane band at 6 o'clock has slits to allow the draining of water and sweat for improved comfort.

description :  These are the latest additions to the new G-SHOCK MOVE  lineup of sports watches, which are equipped with heart rate monitor and GPS.
Useful workout functions include an optical sensor for heart rate measurement, along with bearing, altitude/barometric pressure, and temperature sensors, and an accelerometer for step counting.These five sensors help to keep you in close touch of your current activity in real time. The ability to receive GPS signals lets you access location information when you need it. This, when used in combination with the stopwatch, makes it possible for you to keep track of running information like distance, speed, pace, and more. Your heart rate and speed is used to calculate a VO2 max value, which is an indicator of your cardio-pulmonary capacity.
This measurement is useful when trying to increase stamina for running and other activities. In addition, new phone apps are now available to help you configure watch settings more easily and manage your workouts. You can monitor your current fitness level and training progress, and even automatically create a training plan based on targets specified by you. VO2 max calculation and other data analysis capabilities use a library by FIRSTBEAT, a renowned sport science company. Algorithms of improved accuracy support a higher level of training. The surface form of the back covers of these models reduces interference with the back of the hand, while a soft urethane band provides a better fit to the wrist. Bi-color molded buttons are designed for ease of use, while a high-definition MIP LCD makes display information more legible. Both USB and solar charging are supported, and solar charging can be used to power daily operation (except for pulse monitoring and GPS).

description :  This is new variations on the full-metal GMW-B5000 that incorporate titanium material into their square-face design, which inherits plenty of the DNA of the original G-SHOCK DW-5000C.The case, band, bezel, and back cover of this new model is made of lightweight, easy-on-the-wrist titanium. Titanium is notorious as being a material that is difficult to work with, and its application in this model represents a significant achievement.
The surface of the metal is finished with a diamond like carbon (DLC) coating that protects it against scratching and other damage.The GMW-B5000TCM model is based on the GMW-B5000TB with titanium case, bezel, band, and back, which is laser engraved with a distinctive camouflage pattern. After a DLC coating is applied to the case and band, the gradations of the camouflage pattern are created by using dot patterns of three different sizes: small, medium, and large.This new full-metal GMW-B5000 Series watch maintains the original G-SHOCK concept while improving overall timekeeping quality.

description :  These are the latest additions to the new POWER TRAINER sports lineup from G-SHOCK.
The good-looking designs and utility colors of these models maximize coordination possibilities with both everyday fashions and training wear.
Function-wise, these watches link with the G-SHOCK Connected phone app to provide access to a number of functions that enhance workouts. Daily health and fitness support functions include a 3-axis accelerometer that keeps track of step counts, a Multi-Timer that lets you create up to 20 timer combinations of five timers each, memory for up to 200 lap records, and more. The app also makes it possible to maintain step count logs with five exercise intensity levels, to calculate the calories you burn, to specify a daily step target, to create timer combinations and send them to the watch, to store stopwatch measurement data, to view data, and more. All of this combines to help you plan and record your workouts, making them more effective and enjoyable.
Other features include app-based auto time setting correction and other features for more efficient timekeeping, and an Auto LED Light to facilitate workouts in areas where lighting is dim.
Back wings on the inside of the bands where they connect to the case, a new band ring shape that prevents sliding, and more band holes to allow better tightness adjustment, all add up to a more comfortable fit. You can make fine adjustments to the band size.

description :  "From G-SHOCK, the watch that is constantly testing new limits in timekeeping toughness, comes a new series with Carbon Core Guard structure, which takes toughness to a new level.
The case is made of fine resin that incorporates carbon fiber for light weight along with rigidity that is superior to that of resin. This material protects the internal module from shock-induced damage and deformation. The dual back cover protects the back surface against impact.
Button structure shock resistance has been improved, which eliminates the need for external button guards.
The face of the watch consists of a disk pointer and raised hour markers for a look of bold toughness.
This new standard bearer of the G-SHOCK lineup combines a new shock resistant structure with urban outdoor styling that reflects its toughness.
A new level of toughness
Carbon Core Guard structure
A new carbon core guard structure protects the module by enclosing it in a carbon case made of fine resin embedded with carbon fibers for outstanding strength, crack resistance, and durability. The new shock resistant structure marks an important advance of G-SHOCK core technology, making this model the new standard bearer of the G-SHOCK lineup.

The ability to use the app to create timer combinations and send them to the watch, to store stopwatch measurement data, to view data and more all combine to help you plan and record your workouts, making them more effective and enjoyable. Other features include app-based auto time setting correction and other features for more efficient timekeeping, and an Auto Double LED Light to facilitate workouts in areas where lighting is dim. The small cases of these models are great for active training. Back wings on the inside of the bands where they connect to the case, a new band ring shape that prevents sliding, more band holes to allow better tightness adjustment, and a soft urethane band, which maintains its suppleness even after long wear all add up to a more comfortable fit.

description :  This new MUDMASTER model was created especially for this whose work takes it into areas where piles of rubble, dirt, and debris are present.A special vibration-resistant construction lets them stand up to wear while operating cutters, crushers, drills and other heavy machinery to clear way large obstacles. This is CASIO's first analog watch to come with Mud Resist construction, which helps to ensure that nothing gets into the watch when down and dirty work takes you deep into the dirt and sludge. Multiple gaskets are used on the pipes that guide buttons and shafts, which keeps mud out. These pipes not only act to protect buttons from impact, they also enhance button operation. The screw-in force of the screw lock bezel on an internal gasket further increases mud resistance.A new bezel structure lets you visually check whether the bezel has been screwed in adequately.
In addition, Triple Sensor Version 3 capabilities provide instant access to direction, barometric pressure, and temperature information when needed under tough conditions.The face of the watch is marked with large Arabian numerals as 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock for easy reading. The face is illuminated by a double LED light and protected by a sapphire crystal to ensure high visibility under virtually any conditions imaginable.
The band surface is processed to resemble a cloth band texture, and the hour and minute hands are shaped with points that make them resemble warning markers. All buttons have a checkered surface for surer operation, and the overall design is tough and rugged.

description :  The MTGB1000VL of the MT-G series of watches, which are known for a construction that combines metal and resin, boasts a striking multi-colored design that represents volcanic lightning.
The MTGB1000VL reproduces the frightening yet beautiful blue, purple, and gold colors of the lightning caused by a volcanic eruption with a rainbow ion-plated bezel and a multi-colored dial. The rainbow-colored bezel finished with ion plating is overlaid with the image of the rare atmospheric phenomenon of volcanic lightning, which produces subtle differences in coloring that allow each wearer to enjoy their own unique glow. The MTGB1000VL is also the first MT-G series model to use a semi-translucent red soft urethane material for the band—to represent the aggression of magma bubbling up—rendering a distinct image of power on the wrist.
The base model for the watch is the MTGB1000, which delivered toughness in a compact case by employing a Core Guard Structure that links the bezel and back cover with planar parts. The MTGB1000VL offers a special combination of advanced features like smartphone connectivity and solar-powered radio control with an inventive design.

description :  Introducing a new model from MR-G, the top of the G-SHOCK line, that packs Bluetooth® GPS radio-controlled solar-powered timekeeping into an elegant design featuring a hammered finish bezel.  Traditional tsuiki metal hammering has been used in Japan for centuries in the production of armor, copperware, and other metal implements using a mallet and special chisel that leave marks that create a distinctive pattern on the metal. These marks resemble the scales seen on black dragon drawings and make each item a work of art. The painstakingly hammered patterns of the metal reflect the personality of the artisan who created them, and identify the handmade nature of each item. This traditional Japanese aesthetic sense is applied to a shock-resistant, full-metal body that houses a 3-Way Connected Engine for accurate timekeeping virtually anywhere in the world. The result is absolute toughness and absolute accuracy that is distinctively MR-G.

This model can also be combined with the GBA800 as a his-and-hers pair. The watch can Bluetooth® link with a smartphone, which makes sports activities even more fun, while the G-SHOCK Connected phone app provides access to a number of functions that support workouts. Daily health and fitness support functions include a 3-axis accelerometer that keeps track of step counts, a timer that lets you create up to 20 combinations of five timers each, memory for up to 200 lap records, and more.

description :  This new addition to the EDIFICE metal lineup feature chronograph timekeeping along with advanced functions for linking with your smartphone. The EQB900DB delivers the same accurate timekeeping, multi-functionality, and simple operation as EDIFICE smartphone link series models of the past, along with two additional new features. The first new feature is a high-brightness LED light source between 6 and 7 o’clock, which brightly illuminates the face for easy reading both night and day.  The second feature is a compact, lightweight configuration. The case width and thickness are the smallest of all the EDIFICE smartphone link models. The cases of these models are 2.3 mm smaller in diameter, 2.1 mm thinner, and approximately 25% lighter than the EQB-500D, which was the first EDIFICE smartphone link model. Despite the smaller size, the visual impact of the hour markers and dials have been enhanced to create bold designs.
An Accurate Time System automatically connects to the internet via a smartphone four times a day to acquire timekeeping information and keep watch time settings accurate. Summertime settings are also updated automatically. An app running on a smartphone eliminates the need for complex watch button operations to configure World Time Settings, and increases the number of selectable cities to 300. Another of the many functions that are worthy of special mention is solar power. A large-capacity Tough Solar power system enables long-term use without the need to connect a cable or replace batteries.

Establishing a Bluetooth® connection between this watch and a smartphone ensures accurate timekeeping, including summer time switching, in virtually any country in the world. A phone can also be used to configure a variety of watch settings.A motorsports inspired 1/1000-second stopwatch comes with memory for 200 lap time records, and recording a lap time causes the lower right dial to indicate the average speed. A smartphone app lets you select from more than 300 cities for your World Time City, and simplifies alarm and countdown timer settings.This watch also comes with Super Illuminator, which uses highbrightness LED illumination that automatically illuminates both the analog face and the digital displays are automatically illuminated whenever you angle the watch towards your face where lighting is dim. This impressive collection of advanced features and functions is powered by a solar power system, with a CASIO original shade dispersing solar panel that minimizes shading from the watch hands for highly efficient power generation. The result is uninterrupted, reliable operation without the need for periodic battery replacements.All of this and much more makes EDIFICE a leader in the 1/1000-second world of modern motorsports.Speed IndicatorMeasurement of a lap time calculates and displays an average speed value based on a circuit distance you specify using the smartphone app.

Now the PRT-B50 Series adds Bluetooth® capabilities that enable data communication with a smartphone running the PRO TREK Connected app, for the ultimate in ease of use.
The Quad Sensor system uses compact sensors that make it possible to pack compass, altitude/barometer, and temperature measurements, along with an accelerometer that keeps track of your step count, into a compactconfiguration. Calorie calculations use both step count and altitude information to take upgrades and downgrades into consideration, andcalories burned values are recorded by the app. The app automatically records altitude data measured by the watch and route information acquired
by a smartphone's GPS, and you can manually plot altitude points along your route using a Trekking Log feature. You can also perform a watch button operation to record your current location in memory. Then after you move to a different place, a Location Indicator will point to the direction and display the distance back to the registered location. This makes it easy to
determine the relationship between the two locations, which is an essential capability for outdoor activities.

description :  Introducing Triple Sensor Version 3, advanced CASIO original technology that makes it possible to pack sensors that are 95% smaller than those of previous models into a totally new type of compact PRO TREK. Despite their smaller size, the new sensors in these models deliver higher reading accuracy and improved energy efficiency. These Triple Sensor models deliver altitude, barometric pressure, and direction readings that are more accurate than previous models, and a Barometric Pressure Tendency Alarm alerts the wearer to sudden changes in air pressure. Design features of PRG270B include a CORDURA* nylon fabric band for the ultimate in good fit and durability, and a case designed for outdoor gear performance. Large side buttons and one-press access to digital compass, barometric pressure and altitude, and temperature readings keep important information at your fingertips. Other features include Tough Solar, 100-meter water resistance, sunrise/sunset data and more. Everything about these models is designed and engineered to make them essential pieces of outdoor gear. 


**CORDURA is a registered trademark of INVISTA. CORDURA fabrics are woven from fibers characterized by extraordinary strength and durability. They are frequently used in outdoor gear and luggage, items that require particularly high levels of durability.

description :  Done in collaboration with the seven-time Grammy Award winning artist, the G-SHOCK Ref 6900 by John Mayer was designed by the man himself. This limited edition is inspired by the Casiotone SK-5 sampling keyboard that Mayer played as growing up in Fairfield, CT. The Casiotone SK-5 was instrumental in Mayer’s musical education, and acts as the design catalyst for this timepiece.
When starting the project, it was very important to establish a sense of authenticity, something done with a purpose. When thinking about that question, Mayer went back to his relationship with Casio products from his youth, to find his starting point, the Casiotone SK-5. It acted as the perfect bridge between him as a musician and a watch enthusiast.
The usual aesthetic association of the 1980s involves neo-day glow colors, but during the decade there were some fantastic, subtle, and cool combinations that work well for a modern watch. Looking at the coloration of the Casiotone SK-5, and comparing it to the G-SHOCK Ref 6900 by John Mayer, the inspiration is instantly recognizable. From the overall textured slate gray tone of the case and strap, to the teal “G-SHOCK” at 12 o’clock to the yellow lettering around the bezel, the G-SHOCK Ref 6900 by John Mayer is a great example of ′80s spin on a modern classic.

description :  The evolution of PROTREK never stops. Introducing a new green colorway to the PRG240 line, this model embody some of the very best in functional beauty and ease of operation that modern technology has to offer.
The rotary bezel is specially shaped for easy operation, even while wearing gloves. Large letters indicating north, south, east, and west are colored for easy reading. Dedicated direction, barometer, and altitude buttons provide one-touch access to measurements. Buttons are large with slanted diamond patterns for plenty of slip resistance during operation. Since "easy to press" often also means "more operation error", the back cover is designed to make it the same height of the button surfaces, which greatly reduces the chance of operation error. The result is easy button operation, but only when you need it to be. The number of pointer lines has been increased from 60 to 72 for easier to read World Time and sunrise times. TOUGH SOLAR ensures stable operation even when using power-hungry functions.

description :  Introducing a new model from MR-G, the top of the G-SHOCK line, that packs Bluetooth® GPS radio-controlled solar-powered timekeeping into an elegant design featuring a hammered finish bezel.  Traditional tsuiki metal hammering has been used in Japan for centuries in the production of armor, copperware, and other metal implements using a mallet and special chisel that leave marks that create a distinctive pattern on the metal. These marks resemble the scales seen on black dragon drawings and make each item a work of art. The painstakingly hammered patterns of the metal reflect the personality of the artisan who created them, and identify the handmade nature of each item. This traditional Japanese aesthetic sense is applied to a shock-resistant, full-metal body that houses a 3-Way Connected Engine for accurate timekeeping virtually anywhere in the world. The result is absolute toughness and absolute accuracy that is distinctively MR-G.Returns will only be accepted if product is in original packaging and protectant film is in place.

description :  G-SHOCK pays homage to NASA and the Space Shuttle with its second custom DW5600 timepiece. The commemorative DW5600 honors decades of space exploration and was designed for watch collectors and space enthusiasts in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the first Space Shuttle launch, the OV-102 STS-1 mission on April 12th, 1981.
The new limited-edition timepiece comes in a black and white case and band combination to bring forth the aesthetic of the OV-102 space shuttle. Design elements include a minimalist white dial with red NASA logo, stainless steel case back with an engraved silhouette of the shuttle, an American flag printed on the band loop and black ion-plated buckle. This timepiece arrives in custom packaging with an outer box which reflects STS-1 Mission statistics and an inner tin that depicts the mission’s 2-day orbit around the earth.
The G-SHOCK commemorative NASA timepiece utilizes the DW5600’s iconic case shape and features, plus a one-of-a-kind EL backlight graphic that displays the shuttle silhouette and the years 1981 – 2021 when illuminated.
