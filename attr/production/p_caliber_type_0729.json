	"Manual Wind  Manual Wind Movement: The movement is powered by a thin spiral torsion spring, called the mainspring, which is housed in a barrel inside the movement. The mainspring needs to be wound manually, typically via the crown of the watch. Once the spring is wound the energy from the tension-release of the mainspring drives the movement functions. To ensure uninterrupted operation of the watch, the watch will require rewinding before the mainsprings completely winds down. Most manual-wind watches will have a 35-45 hour power-reserve, yet some might have less & some significantly more, check the specs on each watch to verify the power-reserve duration.",
